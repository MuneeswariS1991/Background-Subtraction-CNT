# Background-Subtraction-CNT
BackgroundSubtractorCNT is a drop in replacement API for the background subtraction solutions supplied with OpenCV. It is much faster than any other background subtraction solutions in OpenCV-3.1.0 and above without NVidia CUDA, especially on low spec hardware. The fastest opencv background subtraction.  Background subtraction is a basic operation for computer vision. If you have a fast system, then choosing one from the choices that come with OpenCV is fine. On the other hand, trying to use any of them on a low spec system will kill your FPS. Learn here why and how the fastest background subtraction is BackgroundSubtractorCNT.
